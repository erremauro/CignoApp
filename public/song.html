Well some may say it's not even funny
                Am      (Am*)   D   (D*)
And there you stand not even trying
      G            (G*)           C/G    
They say it is in line with the ages
            Am      (Am*)      D   (D*)
Sometimes noise is just your mind

         C/G        G*           D   (D*)
But the lesson is vague in the light now
         C/G            G*          D   (D*)
Shows a deer with her mind on the moor 
          G                             C/G
And now something with the sun is just different
            Am                 D     G
Since they shook the earth in 1904

 G(G*)  C(C*)  Am(Am*)   D(D*)                             

           G                          C/G (pause)
And as I lowered down I hear it's a message
          Am               (Am*)           D   (D*)
And it's 1902 just telling people to get out
         G                            C/G     
And if there was just a way I could tell them
           Am      (Am*)     D   (D*)
It's been long but you are right

         C/G         G*          D   (D*)
And the singing is slow and so quiet
          C/G             G*           D   (D*)
Like the sound when you sweep up the floor
           G                             C/G
And now something with the dirt is just different
            Am                 D      G
Since they shook the earth in 1904

 G(G*)  C(C*)  Am(Am*)   D(D*)              x2

             Bm                     C*        (C/G)  
And when the night is young but the bridge is up
          Em                 C*  (C/G)  
Something passing by, I was sure
        Bm               C*      (C/G)
And the only one you can tell it to 
              Em                  D   (D*)
Well it's the only one that ever knows                           

                G                            C/G (pause)
And since more robbers made to go through my window
           Am                    (Am*)                  D  (D*)
Here is something so strange and something louder than before
            G             (G*)        C/G 
And you're living with no light or direction
           Am        (Am*)     D   (D*)
But damn precise and now you know

       C/G         G*              D   (D*)
When believing is hard but you go now
        C/G           G*                D   (D*)
And you feel what you drag across the floor
          G                                  C/G    
Because something with these drills are just different
            Am                D      G
Since they shook the earth in 1904

 G(G*)  C(C*)  Am(Am*)   D(D*)              x2  
                 
             Bm                     C*        (C/G)  
And when the night is young but the bridge is up
          Em                 C*   C/G)  
Something passing by, I was sure
        Bm               C*      (C/G)
And the only one you can tell it to 
              Em                  D   (D*)
Well it's the only one that ever knows

     G                           C/G (pause)
And some will say it's not even healthy
            Am                 D
But body is young and mind is sure
       G                             C/G
That something is alright with your thinking
           Am                 D      G
